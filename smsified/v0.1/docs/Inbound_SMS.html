<p>If you want to check your delivery status before all your messages may have sent out (especially useful if you send an SMS to multiple addresses), you can pull a Delivery Status report using the requestId displayed in Response JSON. This is different than the other reporting options, as it functions in realtime - reporting only shows messages once they've successfully sent to the network or failed completely.<br/>	   </p>

With an inbound subscription, every time a text message is sent to the phone number associated with the subscription, the message will be sent to your URL. This is the same thing you can achieve through the User Interface (outlined in the Receiving a Text Message Quickstart), but using the API you can attach multiple URLs though multiple subscriptions.</p>

<p>It's likely if you're setting subscriptions, at some point you'll want to check out which ones are tied to a particular number. A simple GET on the proper URL gets you what you need. Note: If you omit the destinationAddress, you'll see a list of all your inbound subscriptions.<br/>	   </p>
