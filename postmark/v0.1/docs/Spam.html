<p>Postmark���s spam API is a RESTfull interface to the Spam filter tool SpamAssassin (http://spamassassin.apache.org/). This can be used to pre or post process email content when it is used in your application. For instance, if you process incoming emails from your users you can first run it through the API to filter out junk and avoid clutter in your database and application. Keep in mind: This is free to use and may be updated, removed or changed at any time. For a detailed explanation of the report generated, as well as the test definitions, please visit the SpamAssassin test repository (http://spamassassin.apache.org/tests_3_3_x.html). The POST body must have an element "email" which is the raw dump of the email to be filtered, including all headers. And an element "options" which must either be "long" for a full report of processing rules, or "short" for a score request.</p>
